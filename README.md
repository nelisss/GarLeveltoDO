## Installation

Currently, this project is probably quite unusable. I have made the scripts to suit my needs, which means that they aren't likely to work for your needs. Garmin also has the annoying habit of changing column names every so often. You'll also probably run into problems when trying to run the scripts in terms of package version et cetera. Will be improved!

## Usage

Run the scripts from top to bottom, input the files when prompted.
Connect .csv: from https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activities, scroll down as far as you want and use Export CSV.
Strength Level .csv: from https://my.strengthlevel.com/nelis/workouts, scroll down to the bottom of the page and press Export CSV.
